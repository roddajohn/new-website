    <h2>Parliamentary Debate</h2>
    <p>Parliamentary Debate is the largest middle school debate event as well as the largest collegiate debate event both domestically and internationally.  Three areas where Parliementary Debate differs from more traditional high school debate formats are in the topic selection, interaction with the speaker, and argumentation.
      <br><br>First, there are multiple topic per tournament which are announced 15 - 25 minutes prior to the start of a round, this encourages all paritipants to stay well-informed citizens as the the topics revolve around contemporary issues, both domestic and international topics are used.
      <br><br>Second, speakers, during the first four speeches in a round (the constructive speeches), are required to ask questions of the speaker, interrupting the speech.  There are obviously rules governing this interaction, but these Points of Information (POIS), along with heckles (1-2 word interruptions, usually humorous) make for engaging rounds.
      <br><br>Third, parliamentary debate does not require extensive use of evidence, in fact, use of electronic devices for research during prep is illegal.  Parliamentary debate, instead, focuses on the ability of the participants to make coherent arguments based upon logic and morality, rather than using quotations from long documents.
      <br><br>Although a very short introduction (we encourage you to check out the rules (INSERT LINK), and guides (INSERT LINK) for parliamentary debate, we think that this is a good first peek.  We believe that parliamentary debate creates well-informed, well-spoken, and convincing international citizens.  Furthermore, we believe that all of our debaters are critical thinkers, because of the on-the-fly questioning as well as the necessity of rebutalls, as well as not dependent upon a plethora of research to make an argument.
